# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!
**I hope you enjoy the infamous serious The Big Bang Theory as I do.
Here is a program that takes an input number from you and the computer will randomize an
option to play against you. 

## How to get started:
 > "The game of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" was invented by a software engineer named Sam Kass, who outlined the rules and hand gestures on his website in 1998. He, however, called it "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard"."

 1. Fork or download and unzip the file.
 2. Navigate to the program folder and run this following command:
  This commmnd will compile the C++ source code into an executable file named 'game' that you will then be able to execute to play.
  ```
  $ g++ big-bang-theory-game.cpp -o game
  ```
 3. Now, while you are still in the 'big-bang-theory-game' folder you can run the program through the executable file with this following command:
  ```
  $ ./game
  ```
 4. Perfect, you did it! You're all up and running. The game will pop-up with some instruction. You can press any number that is 1-5. 
  Note: The game will allow you to play one turn before having to run the `./game` command again to play. If you do not like this, you could simply replace '0' inside of the main function
  with `main()`. Just make sure to look above the `=====` to see if you won or lost.
  
  Thank you,
